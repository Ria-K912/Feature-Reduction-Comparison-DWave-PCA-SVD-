<h1>Feature Reduction and Analysis Across Diverse Datasets</h1>

<p>This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of feature reduction techniques applied to four distinct datasets: ECG Heart Disease Dataset, Air Pollution Dataset, Secom Dataset, and Road Accident Dataset. The study employs both classical algorithms and a quantum computing approach to evaluate the efficiency of feature reduction.</p>

<h2>Experimental Approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Classical Algorithms:</b> PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) are utilized to reduce the feature space while attempting to retain the maximum variance of the datasets.</li>
  <li><b>Quantum Computing Approach:</b> The new Hybrid Solver Plug-In Feature Selection by D-Wave is explored as an innovative method for feature reduction.</li>
  <li><b>Comparison and Analysis:</b> The variance of data captured by the reduced set of features is compared across PCA, SVD, and D-Wave Plug-In Feature Selection to identify the most effective technique.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>The analysis reveals a consistent pattern across all four datasets, indicating that the D-Wave Plug-In Feature Selection outperforms classical algorithms when reducing the number of features to a range of 1 to 4. This highlights the potential of quantum computing techniques in effectively reducing dimensionality while retaining critical dataset characteristics.</p>
